        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Urban populations face increasing vulnerability to extreme heat events, particularly in rapidly urbanising Global South cities where environmental exposure intersects with socioeconomic inequality and limited healthcare access. This study quantifies heat vulnerability across Johannesburg, South Africa, by integrating high-resolution environmental data with socio-economic and health metrics across 135 urban wards. We examine how historical urban development patterns influence contemporary vulnerability distributions using principal component analysis and spatial statistics.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Background</h3>
        <p>Climate change is significantly reshaping urban life, with extreme heat events becoming more frequent and severe [1, 2]. Urban populations face increasing vulnerability to these events, with risks shaped by complex interactions between environmental exposure, socioeconomic conditions, and health status [3, 4]. This vulnerability is particularly acute in rapidly urbanising Global South cities, where historical inequalities and limited adaptive capacity compound environmental challenges[5, 6].</p>
