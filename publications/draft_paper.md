## Abstract

Urban populations face increasing vulnerability to extreme heat events, particularly in rapidly urbanising Global South cities where environmental exposure intersects with socioeconomic inequality and limited healthcare access. This study quantifies heat vulnerability across Johannesburg, South Africa, by integrating high-resolution environmental data with socio-economic and health metrics across 135 urban wards. We examine how historical urban development patterns influence contemporary vulnerability distributions using principal component analysis and spatial statistics.

Environmental indicators (Land Surface Temperature(LST), vegetation indices, and thermal field variance) were combined with socioeconomic variables (including crowded dwellings and healthcare access) and health metrics (prevalence of chronic diseases) in a comprehensive vulnerability assessment. Principal component analysis revealed three primary dimensions explaining 56.6% (95% CI: 52.4-60.8%) of the total variance: urban heat exposure (31.5%), health status (12.8%), and socio-economic conditions (12.3%). Built-up areas showed weak but significant correlations with heat indices (ρ = 0.28, p < 0.01), while higher poverty levels demonstrated moderate positive correlations with LST (ρ = 0.41, p < 0.001).

The spatial analysis identified significant clustering of vulnerability (Global Moran's I = 0.42, p < 0.001), with distinct high-vulnerability clusters in historically disadvantaged areas. Alexandra Township showed the highest combined risk (LST: 29.8°C ± 0.4°C, NDVI: 0.08 ± 0.02), with 89.2% of residents dependent on public healthcare facilities. Northern suburbs formed a significant low-vulnerability cluster (Mean HVI = 0.23 ± 0.07, p < 0.001), benefiting from greater vegetation coverage and better healthcare access.

These findings demonstrate how historical planning decisions continue to shape contemporary environmental health risks, with vulnerability concentrated in areas of limited healthcare access and high extreme heat exposure. Results suggest the need for targeted interventions that address both environmental and social dimensions of heat vulnerability, particularly focusing on expanding healthcare access in identified hotspots and implementing community-scale green infrastructure in high-risk areas. This study provides an evidence-based framework for prioritising heat-resilience initiatives in rapidly urbanising Global South cities while highlighting the importance of addressing historical inequities in urban adaptation planning.

## Introduction

Climate change is significantly reshaping urban life, with extreme heat events becoming more frequent and severe [1, 2]. Urban populations face increasing vulnerability to these events, with risks shaped by complex interactions between environmental exposure, socioeconomic conditions, and health status [3, 4]. This vulnerability is particularly acute in rapidly urbanising Global South cities, where historical inequalities and limited adaptive capacity compound environmental challenges[5, 6].

Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city with 6.1 million inhabitants, presents a compelling case study of urban heat vulnerability[7]. The city's rapid urbanisation, pronounced socio-economic inequalities, and historical legacy of apartheid urban planning create distinct patterns of environmental risk[8, 9]. These factors interact with the urban heat island effect to produce heterogeneous vulnerability landscapes, particularly affecting disadvantaged populations [10]. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies, yet comprehensive analyses of urban heat vulnerability in African cities remain limited[2].

## Methods

### 9.1 Data Collection and Processing

We integrated environmental, socio-economic, and health data to assess heat vulnerability across Johannesburg's 135 wards. Environmental metrics were derived from ERA5 reanalysis data and Landsat 8 satellite imagery (December-February 2020-2021), selected for minimal cloud cover (<10%)[24].

Land Surface Temperature (LST) and vegetation indices were calculated using Google Earth Engine. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provided vegetation coverage estimates, the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) provided relative heat intensity measures, and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) quantified urban density.

### 9.2 Analytical Methods

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to identify key dimensions of heat vulnerability. Variables were standardized prior to analysis, and component selection was based on eigenvalues >1.0 and scree plot examination.

## Results

### 10.1 Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis identified three significant components explaining 56.6% (95% CI: 52.4-60.8%) of total variance. The first component accounted for 31.5% of the variance (eigenvalue = 4.73), with the strongest loadings from environmental variables.

### 10.2 Spatial Patterns

The spatial analysis identified significant clustering of vulnerability (Global Moran's I = 0.42, p < 0.001), with distinct high-vulnerability clusters in historically disadvantaged areas.

### 10.3 Correlation Analysis

Examination of Spearman rank correlations revealed several notable associations between socioeconomic indicators and environmental exposures (Table 5). Vegetation cover (NDVI) showed significant negative correlations with household overcrowding (ρ=-0.56, p<0.001) and food insecurity (ρ=-0.58, p<0.001).

## Discussion

### 11.1 Key Findings

Our findings reveal how urban heat vulnerability in Johannesburg manifests through a complex interplay of environmental exposure, socio-economic conditions, and healthcare access.

### 11.2 Implications

These results have important implications for urban planning and public health interventions:
- First, they highlight the need for targeted interventions in high-vulnerability clusters
- Second, they demonstrate the importance of integrating healthcare access into heat vulnerability assessments
- Third, they suggest potential entry points for breaking the cycle of environmental health inequity

### 11.3 Limitations

Although the GCRO Quality of Life Survey provides a rich dataset for exploring urban vulnerabilities, it has some constraints:
- The survey is not primarily designed as a health assessment
- Some indicators rely on self-reported data
- The temporal resolution of environmental data is limited
