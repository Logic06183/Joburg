# Johannesburg Climate Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data visualization and analysis work focused on understanding climate patterns and temperature changes in Johannesburg, South Africa. The analysis combines Earth Engine data with modern visualization techniques to create insightful and publication-ready visualizations.

## Key Features
- Historical temperature trend analysis (1979-present)
- Seasonal pattern visualization and analysis
- Temperature distribution comparisons
- Animated visualizations of temperature evolution
- Publication-ready plotting styles and formats

## Visualizations
The repository includes several types of visualizations:

### Static Visualizations
- `seasonal_temp_distribution_publication.png`: Publication-ready seasonal temperature distributions
- `temperature_ridges.png`: Ridge plots showing temperature patterns
- `temperature_distributions.png`: Comprehensive temperature distribution analysis
- `temperature_change_comparison.png`: Historical vs current temperature comparisons

### Animated Visualizations
- `temperature_evolution.gif`: Animated visualization of temperature changes over time
- `seasonal_pattern.gif`: Seasonal temperature patterns
- `temperature_trend.gif`: Long-term temperature trends
- `hot_days.gif`: Analysis of extreme temperature events

## Technical Details
The analysis is primarily implemented in Python, utilizing the following key libraries:
- Google Earth Engine (ee) for data acquisition
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- NumPy for numerical computations

## Data Sources
- ERA5 temperature data from Google Earth Engine
- Local meteorological data
- Historical climate records

## Usage
The main analysis scripts are:
- `seasonal_analysis.py`: Core analysis of seasonal temperature patterns
- `seasonal_analysis_grouped.py`: Grouped analysis of temperature trends
