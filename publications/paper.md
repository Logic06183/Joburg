## Abstract

Urban populations face increasing vulnerability to extreme heat events, particularly in rapidly urbanising Global South cities where environmental exposure intersects with socioeconomic inequality and limited healthcare access. This study quantifies heat vulnerability across Johannesburg, South Africa, by integrating high-resolution environmental data with socio-economic and health metrics across 135 urban wards. We examine how historical urban development patterns influence contemporary vulnerability distributions using principal component analysis and spatial statistics.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Climate change is significantly reshaping urban life, with extreme heat events becoming more frequent and severe [1, 2]. Urban populations face increasing vulnerability to these events, with risks shaped by complex interactions between environmental exposure, socioeconomic conditions, and health status [3, 4]. This vulnerability is particularly acute in rapidly urbanising Global South cities, where historical inequalities and limited adaptive capacity compound environmental challenges [5, 6].

### 1.2 Study Context

Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city, presents a unique case study in urban heat vulnerability. The city's rapid growth, coupled with its historical spatial apartheid legacy, has created distinct patterns of environmental exposure and socioeconomic vulnerability [7]. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing targeted interventions and adaptation strategies.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Data Sources

We compiled a comprehensive dataset incorporating:
- High-resolution land surface temperature data (30m) from Landsat imagery (1984-2023)
- Socioeconomic indicators from the 2011 Census and 2016 Community Survey
- Healthcare facility locations and accessibility metrics
- Urban development and land use change data

### 2.2 Analysis Framework

Our analysis employed a three-stage approach:
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify key vulnerability dimensions
2. Spatial autocorrelation analysis using Global Moran's I and LISA statistics
3. Historical trajectory analysis examining temporal changes in vulnerability patterns

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Vulnerability Components

PCA identified three primary components explaining 78% of variance:
1. Socioeconomic status (32%)
2. Environmental exposure (28%)
3. Healthcare access (18%)

### 3.2 Spatial Patterns

Analysis revealed significant spatial clustering of vulnerability (Moran's I = 0.68, p < 0.001), with distinct patterns following historical development boundaries. Southern and southeastern wards showed consistently higher vulnerability scores.

### 3.3 Temporal Trends

Historical analysis demonstrated:
- Increasing temperature disparities between informal and formal settlements
- Persistent healthcare access inequalities
- Growing socioeconomic polarization

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Key Findings

Our results highlight the enduring influence of historical urban planning on contemporary heat vulnerability. The spatial concentration of vulnerability in specific wards suggests the need for targeted interventions.

### 4.2 Policy Implications

Findings support:
1. Prioritized green infrastructure in high-vulnerability areas
2. Enhanced healthcare facility distribution
3. Targeted heat adaptation strategies

## 5. Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding urban heat vulnerability in historically divided cities. Results emphasize the need for integrated approaches addressing both environmental and socioeconomic factors in climate adaptation planning.
